There are a lot of kits made with bootstrap, but anyone fits my work needs. Is mandatory to use bootstrap, but with a spice of Material. Daemonite made an amazing job making it.

> Contains all the mixins, functions and variables used in SASS and documented thoroughly.

Are in `docs/sassdoc/` folder inside the `html_static` folder. Name of the file: `index.html`.

There you will see mixins and functions which can contain a lot of annotiations, but the basics and must-have are:
- Description
- Parameters used with it's name, description, type and default value
- Author
- Example - use case of it
- Output - output of the mixin used
- Group - to which belongs

With variables, you will find:
- Description
- Type - if it's a color
- If it's a color, you will see the color behind the variable.

#### Pattern Library
*What is a Pattern Library?*
Is a collection of components, modules and patterns with the code and visual style behind them. Also, named **living document**.

> Contains all the pieces that create your front-end UI.

Are in `docs/pattern-library/` folder inside the `html_static` folder. Name of the file: `styleguide.html`.

There you will see:
- An introduction to that styleguide with name and description
- Each component used in the application grouped by type. `Eg. btn-group and btn are inside Buttons group`
- In component you have: a description of that component, the class used, an example of use and the code
